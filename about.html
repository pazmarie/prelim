                <content>
                    <p>Head to <b>Carmen</b> to tour the famous Chocolate Hills â€“ more than 1,268 grass-covered 
                    limestone domes that are nearly symmetrical in shape and height. The picturesque hills turn a 
                    distinct shade of brown during the dry season and give them a passing resemblance to a 
                    certain confectionary treat, hence their name. To give your sightseeing an extra kick, try 
                    touring the hills by ATV.</p>
 
                    <p>Another popular tourist spot is the <b>Philippine Tarsier and Wildlife Sanctuary in Corella</b>. 
                    Drop by the park for a rare chance to get up close to the Philippine tarsier in its natural 
                    habitat. At just three to six inches tall, this animal is one of the smallest primates in the world. 
                    With gaping eyes, miniscule proportions and a sensitive nature, the tarsier certainly has a 
                    quirky charm.</p>
 
                    <p>Nearby <b>Pamilacan Island</b> has made a name for itself with its move from destructive fishing 
                    practices to sustainable eco-tourism and marine preservation. Most people head here for 
                    dolphin-and-whale-watching tours, but the island also has accessible white sand beaches, 
                    excellent dive sites and even a centuries-old Spanish fort.</p>
